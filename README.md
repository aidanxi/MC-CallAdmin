# MC-CallAdmin
Experimental Minecraft CallAdmin plugin with Discord WebHook support

# How to install
1. Grab the jar from Releases tab and drag it to your plugins folder.
2. (Re)start the server. A default config.yml should appear.
3. Open the config.yml and insert your info in it.
4. Restart the server to apply the changes

# Notes
Make sure the webhook is set to a channel which only admins have access to as the message is set to @here (you will be able to customize it in future releases)

Setting the webhook URL is mandatory for the plugin to work. Default username is set to CallAdmin and Default Server Info is set to "A Minecraft Server". You can leave the webhook avatar blank if you don't want to use it.

Use pre-releases **at your own risk!**
